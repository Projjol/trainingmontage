        <h1>How to Triage!</h1>
        <p>Bug Triaging is the process of moving bugs logically from state to state, so they get resolved in an efficient and easy-to-comprehend manner. </p>
        <p>Go through the bug with status UNCONFIRMED and the component Untriaged using this <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?resolution=---&resolution=DUPLICATE&chfieldto=Now&chfield=%5BBug%20creation%5D&query_format=advanced&chfieldfrom=-60d&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&component=Untriaged&product=Firefox&list_id=7134104" target="_blank">query</a>. Choose a bug from the list.</p>
